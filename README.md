**COVID-19 Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python**
**Overview**
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a COVID-19 dataset using Python. The dataset includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across various regions as of April 29, 2020.

**Dataset Information**
The dataset used for this analysis can be found at: COVID-19 Data. This dataset contains information about COVID-19 cases, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

**Files**
covid_19_data.csv: This CSV file contains the raw data used for the analysis.
covid_eda.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and visualizations for the EDA performed using Python.

**Analysis**
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves investigating the dataset to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representations. The key areas explored include:

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Handling missing values
Correcting data types
Removing duplicates
Descriptive Statistics

**Regional Analysis**
Number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per region
Regions with the maximum and minimum confirmed cases
Regions with the maximum and minimum death cases

**Filtering and Sorting**
Filtering data based on specific criteria
Sorting data to identify trends

**How to Use**
To explore the EDA:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with Jupyter Notebook. You can install Jupyter Notebook as part of the Anaconda distribution, which includes Python and many common packages used in data science.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the covid_eda.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook covid_eda.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

**Visualizations**
The EDA includes various types of visualizations created using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Heatmaps
Bar charts
Line charts
Scatter plots
Box plots
These visualizations are designed to provide insights into different aspects of the COVID-19 dataset.

**Key Findings**
Maximum Confirmed Cases: The United States recorded the highest number of confirmed cases.
Minimum Death Cases: Several regions recorded zero deaths, including Laos, Mongolia, and Mozambique.
India's COVID-19 Situation: As of April 29, 2020, India had reported 33,062 confirmed cases, 1,079 deaths, and 8,437 recoveries.
Filtering Data: The analysis includes methods to filter out regions with less than 10 confirmed cases.
Sorting Data: The dataset is sorted to identify regions with the highest and lowest confirmed, death, and recovery cases.
